 Airline On-time Performance Visualization Using Tableau, Seminars on Business Intelligence, Analytics technology, data-driven culture
### Project on ["AIRLINE ON-TIME PERFORNAMCE VISUALIZATION USING TABLEAU"](<BI Report Final.pdf>)
- Nowadays, Business Intelligence Technologies (Chaudhuri, Dayal & Narasayya, 2011) are widely deployed and used in businesses and industries to be able to analyze large volumes of data and extract insights to support knowledge workers for their decision-making capabilities. Particularly, the airline business sector (Fatima, 2022) uses different Business Intelligence technologies to analyze and monitor climate change, control and analyze flights, as well as forecasting weather conditions to detect risks. Generally, this project deals with data collection and data preparation using Python (i.e. Pandas) for the Tableau BI Tool, and finally the required parameters and features are analyzed, interpreted and reported with the visuals generated.
- The datasets for 1989 and 1999 are available in [US Domestic Flights Datasets](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7)
- Python 3.8, pandas and numpy are used for ETL(Extract, Transform and Load) is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store.
- The visualization is publicly available in the Tableau Public Repository in [Visualization of Airline Ontime Performance | Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/welemhret.baraki/viz/VisualizationofAirlineOntimePerformance/AirlinePerformanceViz). 
- Sample Visualizations of the Project:

## Seminars 
- Two course seminars that covers business technologies, challenges, and data-driven culture were: 
	- The inclusion of Business Intelligence technologies in modern companies critically matters their success in the world marketplace. Studying and using Business Intelligence (BI) is an exciting approach to finding patterns, measuring business performance towards business objectives, performing quantitative analysis, reporting, and identifying customer behavior. Data-driven organizations use BI technologies to help their decision process to take a lead in the competitive market.

	- A Data-driven culture embraces data and analytics in decision making. The organizations that adopt the data-driven culture to utilize and use there in the business decision process are getting better business success than their counterparts. The two seminars give me an opportunity to understand in detail Business Intelligence and adopt a data-driven culture in businesses. In this report, the most important concepts and lessons that I have learned from the previous two seminars are described in brief.
- Full report of the two seminars are available in [Business Intelligence Analytics, Data-Driven Culture](<Final BI Seminar Report.edited.pdf>)
